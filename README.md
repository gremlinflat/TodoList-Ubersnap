# Todo List App - Ubersnap

## Overview

The Todo List App is a demonstration of my iOS development skills, showcasing my proficiency in Swift and SwiftUI. This app allows users to efficiently manage their tasks by providing features such as task creation, editing, and deletion. The app seamlessly integrates with Core Data, enabling persistent storage of tasks on the device.

**Requirements:**
1. Design the user interface using SwiftUI that includes screens for displaying the list of tasks and adding/editing tasks.
2. Implement a local database using Core Data to store the list of tasks persistently on the device.
3. Create a feature that allows users to add new tasks to the database, including a title, description, and due date.
4. Implement the ability to view the list of tasks in a scrollable list with essential task details.
5. Enable users to update existing tasks by modifying their title, description, or due date.
6. Provide functionality to delete tasks from the list, allowing users to remove completed or unwanted tasks.
7. Implement error handling for potential issues such as database errors or data inconsistencies.

## Features

- **Task Management:** Users can easily add, view, edit, and delete tasks using an intuitive interface.
- **Task Details:** Each task includes a title, description, and due date, allowing users to organize and prioritize their tasks effectively.
- **List Display:** Tasks are displayed in a scrollable list with essential details, providing users with a clear overview of their tasks.
- **Deletion:** The app enables users to remove completed or unwanted tasks, enhancing task management efficiency.
- **Detailed Editing:** Tapping on a task opens a detailed screen for editing, providing a seamless user experience.
- **Swipe Actions:** Swipe actions enhance task management. Left swipe reveals a delete action, while right swipe marks a task as "Finished."
- **Core Data Integration:** The app uses Core Data's modern syntactic sugar, including the powerful `@FetchRequest` query, for efficient data management and sorting.
- **Custom ViewBuilder:** A custom ViewBuilder method has been implemented to conditionally apply modifiers based on boolean conditions, improving code readability.


## Challenges and Solutions

- **Transition to SwiftUI:** As a developer with a UIKit background, transitioning to SwiftUI's declarative approach was a challenge. However, through dedication and exploration, I successfully embraced SwiftUI's paradigms.
- **Core Data Modern Syntax:** Adapting to Core Data's modern syntatic sugar, especially `@FetchRequest`, was initially unfamiliar. Thorough research and practice enabled me to integrate Core Data seamlessly.

## Getting Started
